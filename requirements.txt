# AutoSort - File Organizer Requirements
# =====================================

# Required dependencies
# --------------------
Pillow>=10.0.0  # For image metadata analysis and EXIF data extraction

# Optional dependencies (usually included with Python)
# --------------------------------------------------
# tkinter - GUI framework (usually included with Python)
# threading - Thread management (part of Python standard library)
# queue - Thread-safe queues (part of Python standard library)
# pathlib - Path manipulation (part of Python standard library)
# json - JSON processing (part of Python standard library)
# urllib.request - HTTP requests for configuration version checking (part of Python standard library)
# os, sys, shutil, fnmatch, re, subprocess, time, datetime, itertools - Standard library modules

# Installation notes:
# - Pillow is the only external dependency that needs to be installed
# - All other dependencies are part of Python's standard library
# - tkinter is included with most Python installations but may be missing on some Linux systems
# - If tkinter is not available, the GUI version (autosort_gui.py) will not work
# - The command-line version (autosort.py) will work regardless of tkinter availability

# Common tkinter issues and solutions:
# -----------------------------------
# macOS (Homebrew Python): 
#   - Homebrew Python doesn't include tkinter by default
#   - Solution: brew install python-tk@3.13 (or your Python version)
#   - Alternative: Use Python from python.org which includes tkinter
#
# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
#   - sudo apt-get install python3-tk
#
# Linux (CentOS/RHEL/Fedora):
#   - sudo yum install tkinter
#   - or sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
#
# Windows:
#   - tkinter is usually included with Python installations

# To check if tkinter is available:
# python3 -c "import tkinter; print('tkinter is available')"

# To install only the required dependency:
# pip install Pillow>=10.0.0

# To install all dependencies (including optional ones):
# pip install -r requirements.txt
